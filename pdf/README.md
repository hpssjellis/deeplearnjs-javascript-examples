Machine Learning is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience




https://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~shais/UnderstandingMachineLearning/understanding-machine-learning-theory-algorithms.pdf

Machine learning is one of the fastest growing areas of computer science, with far-reaching applications. The aim of this textbook is to introduce machine learning, and the algorithmic paradigms it offers, in a princi- pled way.

This makes sense for researchers in the field, but less sense for learners. A second goal of this book is to provide a view of machine learning that focuses on ideas and models, not on math.

Machine learning teaches computers to do what comes naturally to humans and animals: learn from experience. Machine learning algorithms use computational methods to “learn” information directly from data without relying on a predetermined equation as a model.
