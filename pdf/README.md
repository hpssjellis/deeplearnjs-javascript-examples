This makes sense for researchers in the field, but less sense for learners. A second goal of this book is to provide a view of machine learning that focuses on ideas and models, not on math.

Machine learning teaches computers to do what comes naturally to humans and animals: learn from experience. Machine learning algorithms use computational methods to “learn” information directly from data without relying on a predetermined equation as a model.

Scikit-learn is a Python module integrating a wide range of state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms for medium-scale supervised and unsupervised problems. This package focuses on bringing machine learning to non-specialists using a general-purpose high-level language. Emphasis is put on ease of use, performance, documentation, and API consistency. It has minimal dependencies and is distributed under the simplified BSD license, encouraging its use in both academic and commercial settings. Source code, binaries, and documentation can be downloaded from http://scikit-learn.sourceforge.net.

The web is ubiquitous, yet many machine learning algoriths cannot be readily found and applied in. JavaScript. An inherent downside to machine learning in JavaScript is lack of speed. However, as the language becomes increasingly more popular, the need for machine learning algorithms steadily rises.

 machine learning techniques have required hand-crafted features specialized to a particular domain such as image or voice. In contrast, deep learning has a hugely important benefit that can illustrate data flow from raw data to an objective value in a single neural network and can train thor- oughly using those data.
