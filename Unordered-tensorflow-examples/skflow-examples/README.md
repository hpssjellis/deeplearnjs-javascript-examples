This assumes you have installed tensorflow version 0.8 or higher into the workspace folder called tensorflow.

The directory for the tensorflow examples will be at

/home/ubuntu/workspace/tensorflow/tensorflow/examples/skflow

or from the cloud9 point of view

tensorflow/tensorflow/examples/skflow


A really great tutorial is at
