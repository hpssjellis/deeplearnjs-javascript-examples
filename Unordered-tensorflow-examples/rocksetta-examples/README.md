First try the program hello42.py by getting into this directory from anywhere by typing in a terminal

``` bash
cd /home/ubuntu/workspace/rocksetta-examples/
```

remember to use the tab key as it auto-completes. using cd and ls commands you can move around the workspace 
note: cd .. goes up a directory


Then try the examples in this order

1. hello42
1.
1.
1.


The commands all work the same by running 

python filename.py

``` bash
python hello42.py
```

.
