Presently working on K Nearest Neighbor, a reasonably easy classifier that is not a neural network. This allows baseline estimation of other Machine Learning algorithms.

The plan is to input a csv file like the IRIS or any other CSV

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uiuc-cse/data-fa14/gh-pages/data/iris.csv

auto adjust to the number of variables. Then enter an unknown value and use K Nearest Neighbor calculation of the set to determine a nearest label to the unknown. Then sort the set to find the smalest distance between points. If K = 1 then find the lowest, look at its label and perhaps show the original data. if K = 3 then average the labels from the 3 lowest and show their data. etcf for higher values of K.

Most examples of K Nearest Neighbor use only 2 points and graph the results, but we should be able to do multiple points and just show the results for the nearest values.


Next taking a tensor and doing KNN (Kind of working, need to coordinate K value with labels)

(The above files may be the same, the larger number may be presently woring on and may not work)
