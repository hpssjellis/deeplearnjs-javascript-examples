While putting off some chores I thought I would look into extracting Javascript frokm Observables

This by Nick Strayer looks interesting

https://beta.observablehq.com/@nstrayer/reptile-meta-learning-example


This first file is just the code taken from the observable, not made to run just getting the Javascript. 


First issue is correctly grapping the included code for deeplearn, d3 and vega.

Here is the first demo attempt. Increase the number for latest versions
