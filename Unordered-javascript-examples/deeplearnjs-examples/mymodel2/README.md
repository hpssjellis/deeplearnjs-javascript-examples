Version 2 of my Easiest MNIST

The actual webpage for this version is at 

https://hpssjellis.github.io/deeplearnjs-javascript-examples/Unordered-javascript-examples/deeplearnjs-examples/mymodel2/myModel.html

This is my version of the model-builder by deeplearnjs at

https://deeplearnjs.org/demos/model-builder/


##The plan is to simplyfy the Model Builder so that the Javascript code is easy enough for an average javascript Programmer to understand.


Here is the esaiest model builder

And here is an image of this page at its easiest level

Further work was done by HMA02 to simplify the model at this demo
